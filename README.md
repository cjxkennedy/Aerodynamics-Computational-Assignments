**CA1** 

The composite trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule are used to discretize the cylinder's surface. The number of panels used in each method are investigated for error analysis. The second problem involves using the composite trapezoidal rule to find the lift and drag (per unit span) of a NACA0012 airfoil.

**CA2** tackles visualizing Flow Around Thin Airfoils and Thick Airfoils and the comparing of the lift generated by each of them.

The ThickAirfoil is simulated using an edited version of the provided vortex panel method.

Among the text outputs, we calculated the thick airfoil pressure contours.

The stream lines and equipotential lines for that airfoil are also visualized.

We also get some NACA airfoils coefficient of lift vs angle of attacks estimations and a thin airfoil theory

This is also done for a thin airfoil

  **CA3** has three main sections. First, the comparison of lift generated by cambered airfoils. Then, an approximation of a Cessna 150 wing performance and following analysis. Finally, the validation of the span efficiency factor via comparing with taper ratio.
 
 The NACA_Airfoils function computes boundary points for a given NACA airfoil with the vortex panel method.

  The span efficiency factor (along with coeff. of lift and induced drag) were calculated using the fundamental equation of Prandtl Lifting Line Theory for finite wings (for thick airfoils).
  This allowed for linear spanwise variation of inputs and the final plot:
